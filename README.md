# CSU_DSCI_235_Project

## Overview 

This project is about the Denver nuggets All-star center Nikola Jokic and star guard Jamal Murray

## What about these players

Jamal murrry recently suffered a Torn ACL (Anterior cruciate ligament), and he was the second option to nikola Jokic. 
Though this project i will be taking a look at the general production of the nuggets players indivialy since Murrays injury.
Nikola Jokic is the leading Most Valuable player canidate, in this project I want to make that case clear and compare him to others in the "MVP race" and other MVP's 
before him.
